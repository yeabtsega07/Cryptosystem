## Cryptosystems: RSA Encryption
This repository provides an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm, a widely-used cryptosystem for secure communication. It aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of RSA encryption and serve as a reference for understanding and using this cryptographic technique.

# Description
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used in various applications, including secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange protocols. It relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers to encrypt and decrypt data.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. The implementation includes functions for generating RSA key pairs, encrypting and decrypting messages, and performing digital signatures.
